💳 Online Payment Fraud Detection System
A Machine Learning based web application that detects whether an online transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
Built using Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, and HTML/CSS.

📌 Project Overview
Online payment fraud is increasing rapidly. Traditional rule-based systems fail to detect complex fraud patterns.

This project uses a trained Machine Learning model to predict whether a transaction is:

✅ Not a Fraud Transaction
❌ Fraud Transaction
The system takes transaction details as input and provides instant prediction through a web interface.

🚀 Features
Web-based UI for entering transaction details
Real-time fraud prediction
Label Encoding for categorical variables
ML model integration using joblib
Error handling & input validation
Easy deployment on cloud platforms
🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Model Storage: joblib (.pkl files)
⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/chaitanyaNageli/Payment-Fraud-Detection-Using-ML.git
cd fraud-detection
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install flask scikit-learn joblib numpy pandas

3️⃣ Run the Application
python app.py

Open browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

🧠 How It Works
User enters transaction details:

Step

Type

Amount

Old Balance (Sender)

New Balance (Sender)

Old Balance (Receiver)

New Balance (Receiver)

Transaction type is encoded using encoder.pkl.

Data is passed to trained ML model (model.pkl).

Model predicts:

1 → Fraud Transaction

0 → Not a Fraud Transaction

Result is displayed on the webpage.
